# Dynamic Job Shop Scheduling under Uncertainty
 We present a novel framework for solving Dynamic Job Shop Scheduling Prob- lems (DJSSPs) under uncertainty, addressing challenges posed by stochastic job arrivals and unexpected machine breakdowns. Our approach integrates Coloured Timed Petri Nets (CTPNs) with Maskable Proximal Policy Optimization (MPPO) to enable dynamic action masking. This integration allows the system to rapidly adapt to disruptions without requiring retraining, maintaining scheduling efficiency in unpredictable environments. To simulate realistic industrial conditions, we model dynamic job arrivals using a Gamma distribution, capturing complex patterns such as clustering and bursts. Machine failures are modeled using a Weibull distribution, which takes into consideration age-related degradation and wear-out behavior. We conduct experiments on dynamic JSSP benchmarks, demonstrating that our method outperforms traditional heuristic approaches in minimizing makespan. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of uniting interpretable Petri net models with adapt- able reinforcement learning policies, yielding a resilient and scalable framework for real-time scheduling in dynamic and uncertain manufacturing environments.
